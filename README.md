# Graph-Search-Algorithm
Building and Implementing a Graph Search algorithm with 28 Nodes
In order to represent a graph data structure, the code defines a Python class named Graph. It enables you to search for nodes, add edges between nodes, remove nodes, and print the graph. By building a graph with nodes from "A" to "BB" and carrying out actions like adding, searching, and removing nodes, the sample usage illustrates these functions ("B"). Nodes are keys in the graph's representation, and lists of neighbors are values, akin to a dictionary.

In conclusion, this code offers a fundamental implementation of a graph data structure and illustrates how to add, search for, and remove nodes from a connected graph.
